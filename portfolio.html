    <h2>CSCE 120</h2>
    <img src = "dungeon.png" width = 400 height=400>
    <li>Created multiple technically complex C++ programs that covered a plethora of topics including a dungeon crawler game (image shown above), <a href="https://andrewdcampbell.github.io/seam-carving">seam carving</a>, linked list manipulation, a temperature query system, and more. Overall, the projects that I completed for this class solidified my understanding of the C/C++ programming language and made me appreciate the small details that make up robust code.</li>
    <h2> CSCE 222</h2>
    <img src = "induction.png" width = 650 height=400>
    <li>Covered many logical problems that are useful in the field of computing such as <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/inductive-reasoning/#:~:text=is%20inductive%20reasoning%3F-,Inductive%20reasoning%20is%20a%20method%20of%20drawing%20conclusions%20by%20going,logic%20or%20bottom%2Dup%20reasoning.">induction</a>, counting principles that are useful for problems dealing with huge numbers, combinatorial proofs, etc. The work that I completed for this class made me excel in my problem solving skills. After completing the projects for this class, I now have at my disposal many techniques that I can use specifically for computing problems that am I sure to encounter once I get into the industry. </li>
    <h2>Future Interests</h2>
    <li>Because of my interest in database administration, I would be very interested in technical projects that have to do with setting up a server/database. This interests me because with this task, I would be able to see how comfortable I would be in the interplay between working with both complex hardware and software. Ultimately, this describes the purpose of computer engineers and would give me real insight to how prepared I am for industry jobs.</li>
