      <h2>The SHPE Organization</h2>

    <li>After joining the <a href="https://www.tamushpe.org/">SHPE organization</a> right here at Texas A&M, I have been involved in study group/tutoring sessions every other day. During these sessions, I help my fellow SHPE peers with their weekly assignments and make sure to keep them accountable for the work that they due.</li>
    <h2>Kym's Kids</h2>

    <li>Back home in San Antonio, I was involved with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KymsKidsSA/">local organization</a> that worked with volunteers to service their events. These events included races for young children, food drives, and other charity events. During my time there, I found a love of helping others and would like to be a part of some other organization that does similar things.</li>
    <h2>Hopeful Future Service Opportunity</h2>
    <li>In the future, I hope to be involved with an organization that teaches young children how to code simple programs. I think this would be an incredibly useful opportunity for said children to gain experience in coding and see if the type of work that they would be doing as a coder seems at all appealing to them.</li>
