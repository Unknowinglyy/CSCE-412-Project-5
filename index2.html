    <p class="text" id = "about">Hello! This website's purpose to tell you all about me, Blake Dejohn. Currently, I am in the process of gaining a degree in computer engineering from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University </a>and am looking to gain as much experience in all things computing (as a computer engineer, this means both hardware and software). I have a list of qualifications which includes being a <a href="https://www.dellscholars.org/">Dell scholar</a> and have interests in the field of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-dba/#:~:text=A%20database%20administrator%2C%20or%20DBA,features%20and%20troubleshoot%20any%20issues.">database administration</a>.I have also been involved with a volunteering company in my home town of San Antonio and continue to help others currently with my involvement in the SHPE organization here at Texas A&M. In the future, I hope to help even more people find their love of computing by teaching simple programming to children. To summarize my experience with computers, however, I would say that I have been mostly self taught before coming to Texas A&M. Coming from a not so privileged background, I had trouble finding the resources that would truly teach me what I wanted to learn about computers. Despite this, during this self teaching phase, I learned numerous topics such as how to build my own personal computer while in middle school, completely learned Python, learned the concepts behind many data structures, and dipped my toes into the Java programming language. Moving on, I have learned so much during my time here at A&M. Overall, after what feels like three very short semesters, I have mastered the C/C++ programming language, gained a more robust understanding of the data structures used in so many technical applications, learned programming practices that are used in industry, and strengthened my already analytical mind through the understanding of logical problem solving techniques. With this in mind, I hope that even with my lack of experience, you can overall look at this website and get a view into me as an individual. (This is actually my first time ever using both HTML and CSS!) </p>
